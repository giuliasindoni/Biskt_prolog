**biskt.pl:** newest version (03/07/2019) with rules updated and working. 

## Get started:

- run `gprolog` in the terminal
- load `[biskt].`

### To run the program on an example formula:
- go to the line at the end of the **biskt.pl** file
```prolog
run :- run(12).
```
- this is currently running on example formula 12
- modify accordingly with the example number you'd like to run
- save and re-run the prolog file as normal

You can also define your own examples by extending the code
