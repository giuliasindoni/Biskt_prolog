biskt_19_june_working: this file is working. However, the rule for true implication is not finished, and the modalities need to be added. 


biskt_28_june: this file is biskt_19_june_working plus I wil add the correct version of the rule for true implication and I will add the rules for modalities.

biskt_old: is the old version of biskt, where we didn't split the rules in branching/not-branching/cretaing. It is the first file created. 

biskt.pl: newest version (3rd of July) with rules updated and working
